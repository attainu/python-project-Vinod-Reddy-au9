This is the chess game 

TO create this game I have installed Python 3 latest version and also I have installed Pygame 

This game is built based on Python OOPS principles

I have align the below functionality to each piece.

The Board

The chess board is an 8 by 8 grid. The initial configuration of the pieces is as follows:

The Pieces

Pawns :

Normally move forward one space.
Move diagonal one space to kill.
May move two spaces forward on the first move.
But may be killed En Passant after this move by attacking the space behind the pawn.
May be exchanged for any piece except a King by reaching the opposite side of the board.

Bishops :

Move diagonally any distance.
Kill by landing on a space occupied by an opponent's piece..

Knights :

Move in "L" shape (one space one direction, two in a perpendicular direction).
May go "over" other pieces.
Kill by landing on a space occupied by an opponent's piece.

Rooks :

Move horizontally or vertically any distance.
Kill by landing on a space occupied by an opponent's piece.
May "castle" with the king under certain circumstances (see below).

Queens :

Move any distance horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Kill by landing on a space occupied by an opponent's piece.

Kings :

Move one space horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Kill by landing on a space occupied by an opponent's piece.
May "castle" with a rook under certain circumstances (see below).

The game is over:

when the opponent's king cannot escape being taken (i.e. Checkmate).
or one player can make no move without putting his/her king in danger (i.e. Stalemate)
